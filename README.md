OCDNet: Obsessive Convolutional Desne Net

OCDNet is generated for large scale images classification, which shows about 20% better performaces than State-Of-Art Models 2021(VGG, Resnet... etc)

OCDNet uses parataxis CNN architecture, which is the Convolution Layer layed parallelly like as a node of Linear Layer.
